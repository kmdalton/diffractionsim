# Python Module for Simulating Crystallographic Rotation Series

This is a very simple module for seleting reflections that intersect the reflecting sphere at a given crystal orientation. 


# Installation

It is recommended to use the Anaconda python distribuation with this library. Aside from standard libraries the only prerequisites for running this code are 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

Additionally, it is a good idea to have Phenix installed for calculating structure factor amplitudes. 


# Examples
The test directory contains some sample code for computing reflection positions (see test/plot_rot_series.py).
